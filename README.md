# Community Mental Health Charter

Welcome to the collaborative project "Minds for All" – a global coalition of activists, community leaders, and mental health professionals from low- and middle-income countries.

## Purpose

This repository hosts the co‑creation of a **Charter for Ethical and Sustainable Community Mental Health**. The charter aims to provide a set of guiding principles that local organizations can use to develop and advocate for mental health services that are:

- **Rights‑based** – centering human rights, autonomy, and dignity.
- **Culturally relevant** – grounded in local knowledge and practices.
- **Community‑led** – designed, implemented, and owned by the communities they serve.

## Our Commitment to Participatory Principles

We believe that the process of creating the charter must be as important as the final document. To ensure transparency, equity, and genuine participation, we are using an open, public GitHub workflow. This allows every contributor—regardless of their technical background—to see the draft, propose changes, discuss ideas, and help shape the charter in a transparent and accountable manner.

## How to Contribute

1. **Explore the draft** – Start by reading the current version of the charter in [`CHARTER.md`](./CHARTER.md).
2. **Join the conversation** – Go to the [Issues](../../issues) tab to see the list of open topics. Each issue corresponds to a major section of the charter. You can comment on existing issues or open new ones to raise questions or suggest additions.
3. **Propose changes** – If you have a concrete amendment to the charter text:
   - Fork this repository (or create a branch if you have write access).
   - Edit the relevant file(s) in your branch.
   - Submit a Pull Request (PR) with a clear description of your proposal.
   - The PR will be reviewed by other coalition members, and your changes will be merged after discussion and consensus.
4. **Review and discuss** – Everyone is encouraged to review open Pull Requests, leave inline comments, and help refine the language and substance of the charter.

## Code of Conduct

We strive to create a respectful, inclusive, and safe environment for all contributors. Please be mindful of diverse perspectives, especially those of marginalized communities, and engage in dialogue with empathy and humility.
